                To my pwetiestteststst girl,<br><br>
                Since I met you, my life has been filled with color, laughter, and all the crazy moments we've shared along the way. When you came into my life, so much changed the way I see things, the way I think about the future, and the way I want to move forward with you by my side 🤍. You made me better, and I have to say this because it's true it's not easy to deal with someone like me, serious at times 😐 and completely crazy at others 😜.
                I know every day isn't the same, but I still feel the same way I felt when ever since I first saw you 🫶.
                Whenever I'm with you, I'm different in the best way. I smile more 😊, I laugh more 😂, and I don't feel the need to pretend that everything is okay.
                I'm truly glad for you, and I always appreciate the time we spend together and the things we do together. You make me feel seen, unbiased, and special through everything you do.
                I don't say “thank you” as often as I should, so this is my chance to do it properly from the bottom of my heart❤️, my mind, and Frankie. Thank you for your kindness and for always putting up with my weird shenanigans.
                You are never a burden to me. If anything, you are the source of my happiness. Through all the time we've spent together, you've made every day feel extra special whether we're together or apart 💞.

                As long as I'm here, I will always bring you to a place where it's okay to be weak. Yes, there have been ups and downs because of me, and I'm honestly working on fixing that myself that part is on me. I am grateful for you. Truly wholeheartedly.
                Now, when I picture happiness, it's your face I see first laughing, giggling at my unhinged jokes. You won't always see yourself the way I do, but I'll keep reminding you until you do.
                You are so, so, so incredibly gorgeous but honestly, that's the least interesting thing about you. 
                You're beautiful anyone with eyes can see that. You walk into a room and people notice without you having to try at all. It's like the atmosphere the universe shifts, like the energy adjusts simply because you're there.
                But beauty is one of the easiest thing to notice. It takes no effort to point out on someone's face.
                What I see in you takes attention. It takes time. It takes really knowing you deeply. And that's the part of you that makes you unforgettable.
                I notice your laugh too not the polite one you use when you're trying to be quiet, but the real one. The one that takes over your whole body. The one you try to hold back because you're afraid it's too loud, too much. But honestly, just hearing that laugh makes me laugh. It fills the room in a way nothing else ever does for me.
                I notice how your eyes change when you talk about something you truly care about the way they sparkle, yes, but more than that, the focus, the passion, the way your entire voice lifts and enchant the whole room. It's like watching a flame catch fire, like a dewdrop resting on a blade of grass. Even when you try to hide it maybe without even realizing it that passion still shows, and it's one of the most beautiful things about you.
                That kind of beauty can't be put on with makeup. It can't be faked or recreated. The way you care leaves marks on the people lucky enough to know you. Your beauty may turn heads, but your soul, the way you love, the way you give, the way you dream that's what makes people stay. That's what makes you unforgettable.
                And then there are the moments no one else sees the way you go quiet when you're hurting, the way you try to hold yourself together because you don't want to burden anyone with your pain. You carry your hurt like you owe the world an apology for it, like you have to be strong all the time. And somehow, even in those quiet moments, you still show up for people with your whole heart.
                That's strength. And it's rare.
                People think they know you because they see your face. But if they paid attention the way I did if they really paid attention they'd realize your looks are just the cover, not the story.
            Yes, you're gorgeous. But honestly, that's the least extraordinary thing about you. Your real beauty lives in the parts of you the world never sees unless they earn it and that's the part of you I never stop being in awe of.

                I don't know how long we have, but I want whatever time we do have to be special for us. I want it to be meaningful, memorable, and something that feels right for both of us. I don't want to overpromise or say things just to sound good and end up underdelivering. When I say I'm here for you, I truly mean it and I take ownership of that.
                You will always have someone you can rely on. I may not be perfect; I am with flaws, cuts, and unhealed bruises, but I want to work on those for us, for you, and for myself in the healthiest and best way I can.
                I am so, so, so incredibly grateful for you, in ways I don't even know how to put into words. Thank you for bringing back joy, laughter, and happiness into my life, things I didn't even realize I had been missing for years. I might not be able to express it all 
                Thankkkkk youuu 💕 for the thoughtful gifts the cool jacket, the Porsche T-shirt, the best bracelet, the perfume, and my favorite crochet lily in my favorite color and the handwritten kissed letter. Every single thing meant so much to me.
                Thankkkkkk youuuuuu 💕 for making my first Valentine's Day truly special. I had honestly never celebrated Valentine's before, and this being my first and so meaningful, entirely because of you.
                I will always be around whenever you need me. And thank you   truly   for being kind with me, patient with me, and for choosing me the way you do. I'm really glad it's you.

                I will alway be around when ever you need me and Thank you for being you Madiha💕<br>
